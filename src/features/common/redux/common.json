If you have a fair idea of how far you're going or how much you're willing to pay, this is probably a good idea. If the driver refuses, turning around and walking away will almost certainly change his mind. Don't sweat it, it's all part of the expected negotiation protocol. It has also become common for the drivers of some of the less reputable taxi companies to \"fix\" their meters to run faster hence running up a high bill very fast! The recommendation is to only use the reputable and reliable taxi companies. These are Hanoi Group Taxi, ☎ +84 4 3856 5656), Mai Linh Taxi , ☎ +84 4 3861 6161). As a reference point, Hanoi Group Taxi charges an initial fee of 14,000 dong as a starting price that covers the first few kilometres, then 16,300 dong for every additional kilometre of travel, with 6,000 dong for every 5 minutes of travel. Given this, you should be able to get a general sense of what a reasonable price is in getting around town. Thanh Nga taxis (+84 4 4 3821 5215) are cheaper with smaller, hatchback cars, starting at 9,000 dong + 12,000 dong/km.\nAnother common scam by taxis is that the driver takes you for a \"sightseeing\" - and extends the tour to make more money. This is very hard to discover unless you know the city well, but if you catch your driver doing this (e.g. going around Hoan Kiem Lake twice), demand that he stop the taxi and leave the taxi without paying. \nBe very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi. Meters have been known to operate \"normally\" initially, but after you've let your guard down, it jumps to astronomical amounts just before the destination. Some have central locking, and are known to lock passengers in, and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go. The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands, but if you kick up enough of a fuss, they will let you go.\nMost taxi drivers speak limited English, so it's a good practice to get your hotel to write the name and address of you destination in Vietnamese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.\nBe vigilant when taking a taxi - driver jumps out at destination and dumps most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting rucksack on he has taken off with your other bags.\nBe vigilant also  the  meter which  can  run as far or  even faster than a  digital clock. A 10min drive can rack up almost USD30 in downtown Hanoi alone! Do  keep an  eye on the meter during  the  journey. Fare flag drops starting at 15,000 dong. Bottom line: Stick to the reliable taxi companies listed above to avoid scams. You should take photo or remember taxi number in case you are in bad situation, you can solve it.\nWhen getting off your taxi wait for the driver to open your door, or check both front and back to see if there are any motorcycles whizzing past before opening your door. Although Vietnam is right-hand traffic, ghost motorbike riders could be approaching your taxi on the wrong side.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":10,"sectionName":"Get around","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"By taxi"},{"content":"As of December 2018, Uber is no longer available in South East Asia, including Vietnam. \nGrab offers an Uber-like service, along with several options: GrabCar (private car), GrabTaxi (metered taxis using the Grab app) and GrabBike (hop on the back of a GrabBike tagged motorbike, helmet provided).

Low level street crimes like bag snatching regularly occur in major cities like Hanoi and Saigon. Few instances of knife attacks during robberies have been reported.\nAvoid fights and arguments with locals (especially groups). Keep in mind that yelling is highly insulting to Vietnamese, so the reaction of a Vietnamese in such a situation may be unexpected.\nAs a foreigner, Vietnamese expect you to act a certain way in their country. You should respect the general law of the land. Most of these arguments can be avoided easily by showing general courtesy, and tolerating cultural differences that may seem rude to you.\nStreet robbery\nTouristy areas and high population cities in Vietnam are areas to watch for thieves, pickpockets, and scammers. They especially target foreigners. Pickpockets and motorbike snatching have found their home especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Nha Trang. Thieves on motorbikes will snatch bags, mobile phones, cameras, and jewelery off pedestrians and other motorbike drivers, and it is a crime committed so regularly that even local Vietnamese are common victims. Avoid dangling your bags along traffic roads. Talking on your mobile phone next to cars on the road and putting your bag on the front basket of a motorbike will tempt a robber. It could happen day or night, in a crowded road with hundreds of drivers. Pickpockets are well organized and operate in groups.\nIf you travel by motorbike, be aware that crooks can cause serious security issues. Reports of people claiming that \"your motorcycle is on fire\" and offering to repair it or passers-by that throw nails at foreigners on motorcycles are frequent.\nTheft\nAlso infamously common are thefts on popular beaches.

One certain trait of Vietnamese scams is that there seems to be no limit to what people would try to overcharge you. It is pretty common for the scammers to attempt to overcharge you by ten or fifty times and sometimes even more.\nA very common one is when the organizers claim that the bus broke down and the tour operators force people to pay huge amounts for crummy hotels \"while the bus is repaired\".\nBe careful when going to a shop or restaurant that doesn't have prices written down. Before eating a meal, ask for the price or you may be in for a surprising bill. When you embark on a tourist tour, be independent: know where you are at all times and be aware of alternatives; the tour might suddenly fall apart. \nThe police are probably the worst crooks of them all. They are known to steal items from people (both locals and tourists) and ask for a steep bribe to get the item in return. Also, don't count on them for any help if you are victim of crime.\nMost scams in Vietnam are in transport, hotel prices and the two-menus system practiced by some restaurants. \nHotel owners may tell you that the room price is 200,000 dong. However, when checking out, they may insist that the price is USD20, charging you almost a double. Another trick is to tell customers that a \"room\" is a few dollars, but following day they'll say that price was for a fan room only and it's another price for an air-con room. These days, legitimate hotel owners seem to be aware of these scams and are usually willing to help by writing down how much the room is per person per day (in US dollars or dong), if it has air con or not. Staff of legitimate hotels also never ask for payment from a guest when they check in. Watch out if they insist that you should pay when you check out but refuse to write down the price on paper.\nSome restaurants are known to have two menus, one for local people and another one for foreigners. The only way to deal with it is to learn a few Vietnamese phrases and insist that you should be shown only the Vietnamese menu. If they hesitate to show you the local menu, you better walk away.\nOn rare occasions restaurants have two (English) menus with different prices. Taking pictures of all menus might be excessive, but if you suspect that the food had a different price when ordered, stand your ground. We usually memorize the prices of what we order and pay exactly that. The owners rarely make a big deal out of it because they know they cheated. Otherwise ask for the police.\nMany taxi drivers in Saigon and Hanoi install rigged meters, charging up to 2 to 8 times more. The best way to reduce your chances is by taking a taxi from reputable companies such as Mai Linh (+84 38 38 38 38) and Vinasun in Saigon and Mai Linh and Hanoi Tourist for Hanoi (but note that taking these companies is not a guarantee, and travelers have had problems even with reputable companies). If you don't know what a reasonable fare is, it is generally a bad idea to agree on a price in advance. Spoken for Saigon, the two recommended companies have quite reliable meters. Vinasun taxis usually have notices explaining that the meter value should be multiplied by 1000 to obtain the fare. Some drivers will take advantage of the ambiguity, and tourists' lack of knowledge about what the fare should be, so it is best to have things clearly written out.\nTaxis are abundant in Saigon - and you can get a taxi at any time of the day or (night). You can also call a Taxi, and usually people at call centers will be able to either converse in English, or will pass on the phone to someone who can. Rule of thumb to detect scammers: if the taxi doesn't have the fare charges written, or drivers name and photo on the dashboard, immediately ask the taxi to stop and get out. It's a definite scam.\nWhen leaving the airport, the taxi driver may insist that you pay the airport toll. He might not be very forthcoming about the price and, if you give him cash, he will pay the toll and pocket the rest.\nMany taxi drivers in Sai Gon and Ha Noi try to overcharge thin faced, just arrived, and gullible travelers. You should consult some guidebooks and travel forums to prepare yourself for those petty scams and to learn more about how to avoid them. The airport toll fee in Saigon is 10,000 dong (as of July 2012) - this is  also written, along with the fare, on the dashboard of the taxi. You can confidently say \"airport toll only 10,000\" and refuse to pay anything else such as parking etc. (unless there were more toll roads in between). Usually, the driver will not argue it out. In Saigon, a trip to Backpackers Street should not cost more than 250,000 dong from the airport in any case.\nIn several other cities of Vietnam, such as Dalat, Hoi An, Nha Trang etc. - DO NOT travel by meter. The airports are as far as 30-40km from these places and meter will cost you from 500,000 to 650,000 dong. However, you can either take a bus from the Airport to  the city center, or pre-negotiate rates with taxis from 200,000-300,000 dong. Refer to individual sections for details. Pay attention to sides of taxi - usually a rate for Airport drop is written on the door itself. \nTaxi and cyclo drivers may claim that they don't have change when accepting payment for an agreed-upon fare.  The best way to handle this is to either carry smaller bills or be ready to stand your ground.  Generally the driver is only trying to get an extra dollar or so by rounding the fare up, but to prevent this scam from becoming more popular it is advised to stay calm and firm about the price.  \nWhen you meet an over friendly cyclo driver who says, \"never mind how much you would pay\" or \"you can pay whatever you like at the end of the trip\". He even tries to show you his book of comments from international tourists. This kind of driver has to be a scammer. If you still want to use his service you should make it clear about the agreed price and don't pay more than that. Just be clear what you are willing to pay; the cyclo drivers are just trying to make a living.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"country","name":"wikitravel country","page":"Vietnam","section":71,"sectionName":"Stay safe","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Scams"},{"content":"Corruption is a big problem in Vietnam and locals are convinced that the police are not to be trusted.

Remember to stand your ground and all officers are required to write all traffic violations in their notebook and give you a receipt with directions to pay to the station (not the officer).

Men on motorbikes rush around delivering potted tangerine trees and flowering bushes, the traditional household decorations. People get a little bit stressed out and the elbows get sharper, especially in big cities, where the usual hectic level of traffic becomes almost homicidal. Then a few days before Tết the pace begins to slow down, as thousands of city residents depart for their ancestral home towns in the provinces. Finally on the first day of the new year an abrupt transformation occurs: the streets become quiet, almost deserted. Nearly all shops and restaurants close for three days, (the exception being a few that cater especially to foreign visitors; and hotels operate as usual.)\nIn the major cities, streets are decorated with lights and public festivities are organized which attract many thousands of residents. But for Vietnamese, Tết is mostly a private, family celebration. On the eve of the new year, families gather together and exchange good wishes (from more junior to more senior) and gifts of \"lucky money\" (from more senior to more junior). In the first three days of the year, the daytime hours are devoted to visiting -- houses of relatives on the first day, closest friends and important colleagues on the second day, and everyone else on the third day. Many people also visit pagodas. The evening hours are spent drinking and gambling (men) or chatting, playing, singing karaoke, and enjoying traditional snacks and candy (women and children.)\nVisiting Vietnam during Tết has good points and bad points. On the minus side: modes of transport are jammed just before the holiday as many Vietnamese travel to their home towns; hotels fill up, especially in smaller towns; and your choice of shopping and dining is severely limited in the first days of the new year (with a few places closed up to two weeks). In Saigon, most shops are closed for a whole week after new years day. Restaurants may charge a higher than normal price, e.g. adding a 20% \"Happy New Year\" fee. Beware that crowded places are ideal for pickpockets. On the plus side, you can observe the preparations and enjoy the public festivities; pagodas are especially active; no admission is charged to those museums and historical sites that stay open; and the foreigner-oriented travel industry of backpacker buses and resort hotels chugs along as usual. Visitors also stand a chance of being invited to join the festivities, especially if you have some local connections or manage to make some Vietnamese friends during your stay. When visiting during Tết, it's wise to get settled somewhere at least two days before the new year, and don't try to move again until a couple of days after.\nLesser holidays include:\n\nNew Year 1 January.\nHùng Kings' Festival (Giỗ tổ Hùng Vương) on the 10th day of the 3rd lunar month commemorating the first kings of Vietnam.\nLiberation Day (Ngày giải phóng miền Nam) on 30 April, marking the fall of Saigon in 1975. \nInternational Workers' Day (Ngày Quốc tế Lao động) 1 May, the traditional socialist labour day.

Of course \"rich\" is defined as \"anyone with more money than me\". This is not limited to white foreigners only; even Vietnamese, especially from the South, are routinely overcharged in Hanoi. A number of sellers won't even haggle at all after quoting a ridiculous amount, as they would rather sell a single item with 2000% profit than sell much more for a reasonable price. So if you're going to other cities, do your shopping there.\nIf you do need to shop in Hanoi, try to buy from younger sellers, they seem to be more honest than older ones. This means they'll only try only to ask 4x the item price, and not 10x. Also at the tourist markets some stalls have a \"no discount\" sign, and those typically offer prices much closer to reality, which should be used as a reference. Note that in Hanoi it still won't prevent a seller at the next table from asking twice the price of the \"no discount\" table for the same item.\nAvoid sellers who set prices in dollars/Euro, as this dramatically limit your ability to haggle. Note that even $1 is still too much for many souvenirs, for which the fair price is 20,000 VND.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":36,"sectionName":"Buy","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Overcharging"},{"content":"Money changers are usually in most guest houses and banks, and they give bad rates. Don't exchange money from the black market people on the streets. The best place to exchange money is at Ha Trung Road and Hang Bac, where they give very reasonable rates. Just walk into the gold shops or jewelry shops and ask them if they change money, and ask them to show their rates. Ask several more shops to see which shop gives the best rates. Best rates usually are at Ha Trung, which is 15-25 mins. walk west from Hoan Kiem lake. Look for Hang Da Market on the pedestrian map:  it's a short street of gold traders and small sewing factories.  (Correct as at Dec 18th 2014)\nInside the Noi Bai airport arrival hall, there are several money changer booths of major local banks.  Unlike in many airports, their exchange rate is competitive (around +/-1% to mid-market for USD) and do not seem to differ from the rate in the city offices (which you won't find at Old Quarter anyway). Besides US dollars and euro, they will change currencies of major Asian countries; that may come handy if you come from (or was traveling in) these countries. Rates vary slightly between the banks, so you may like to shop around and to see what you will get.\nCurrencies accepted for exchange (into Vietnamese Dong: VND) at Vietnam banks include USD / EUR / HKD / JPY, etc. But a warning about Chinese Yuan (RMB or CNY): for some strange reason Vietnam banks (at least all the ones in Hanoi) do NOT exchange Chinese currency. If you need to change RMB into VDN, go to the gold shops on 'Ha Trung' Road (as explained above).\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":37,"sectionName":"Buy","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Money Changers"},{"content":"ATMs are everywhere and cash is king here.

The Techcombank SE of the Hoa Lo Prison allows transactions of at least 7 million dong (these statements may be outdated). In the Old Quarter, Techcombank, Vietcombank, DongA, etc etc all have limits of 2,000,000 - 3,000,000 dong with the majority sitting at the paltry 2,000,000 dong limit. The notable exceptions are ANZ, HSBC, and CitiBank; the ANZ on the western shore of the Hoan Kiem Lake allows up to 5,000,000 dong (updated June 2014), all HSBC ATMs around the city have a limit of 5,600,000 dong (June 2014), and Citibank (there is an ATM on the north side of Hoan Kien Lake for example) leads with a 8,000,000 limit (July 2014). The HSBC at the north end of Hoan Kiem lake has a cash withdrawal limit of 8,000,000 dong (June 2018). \nCheck exchange rates daily. Jewelery shops will consistently offer a better rate than banks or hotels.\nFees - SHB Bank atms charge a 55,000 Dong fee without warning. \nIf you arrive in to Noi Bai Airport without any Vietnamese dong be careful about using the ATMs in the airport arrivals area. The BIDV ATM charges a 99,000 dong fee (as of Jan15) for a withdrawal (max 3m dong withdrawal) but doesn't notify you of this charge until the end when the transaction has completed. It might be wise to bring sufficient dong for your taxi/bus ride in to Hanoi in advance and then use one of the other ATMs (as mentioned above) with lower fees.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":38,"sectionName":"Buy","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"ATMs"},{"content":" Hang Da.

It has held that title for more than a thousand years, through several invasions, occupations, restorations, and name changes. The Chinese conquered the imperial city of Thang-Long in 1408 and renamed it Tống Bình. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and ascended the throne, becoming known as Lê Thái Tổ (黎太祖); for his efforts, a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around the Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarter. \nThe Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to Hue by then; it remained there until 1887, when the French made Saigon and then Hanoi the capital of all French Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam; Saigon was the rival in South Vietnam. Upon reunification in 1975, it assumed that title for the entire country.\nThe first institution of learning in Vietnam, Quoc Tu Giam, was founded here in the 11th century. Nine hundred years later, the first western-style universities in Vietnam were also founded in Hanoi. The city is one of the leading centres of scientific study and research in the country. Hanoi retains much of its older charm of bygone eras, despite the battles that have raged over it; conflict had the side effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city centre area are higher than five stories. The Old Quarter is second only to Hoi An for uninterrupted stretches of colonial and pre-colonial architecture, well-preserved on dense warrens of narrow, wonderfully atmospheric streets. It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of Ho Chi Minh City in the South for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two, and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.\nAs you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. It takes a while to get used to that. However, there are times when you find this friendliness extremely helpful, such as when you are lost or need help. \nThe Tourist Information Centre, ☎ +84 4 926 3366, Dinh Tien Hoang, just north of Hoan Kiem Lake, can provide a fairly useful map although bewilderingly, the blow-up of the Old Quarter is missing, making it useless in that part of town. The Centre also offers free internet and English-language advice.\nThere are self-help interactive screen information booths around the Old Quarter but their purpose is to superficially conjure an image of coming-of-age \"Vietnam has arrived\" impression to the unsuspecting passer-by. An example was an inquiry typing out the American Embassy as prompted by an empty field, then it flashed on to the next interactive page asking for which district (one may not be aware that the US embassy has branches in every district) - smart and amazing!\n\n  Ho Tay/West Lake, Hanoi\nClimate","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":2,"sectionName":"Understand","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Understand"}]}],"things to do":{"all":[{"content":"Foreign Trade University (FTU) is a university established in 1960, located in Hanoi, Vietnam with satellite campuses in Ho Chi Minh City and Quảng Ninh.

The complex consists of one 72-story Mixed-use tower with the height of 350 m and two 48-storey hotel twin towers. Landmark 72 is located on an area of 46,054 m2 and the total floor area is 609,673 m2, ranked 5th as the largest floor area of a single building in the world. The investor as well as the executor and operator of this complex is the South Korea-based company named Keangnam Enterprises, Ltd. The investment capital for this complex is estimated $1.05 billion USD.On November 2010, the main tower reached approximately 300 metres, making it the tallest building and structure in Vietnam. On 24 January 2011, the main tower topped out at 350 metres; it became the tallest building in Vietnam while the other two towers had topped out months before with the height of 212 metres.\nThe complex features a 5-star InterContinental hotel, offices, entertainment areas, retail spaces, clinics and convention centres. The complex opened for business on 18 May 2012. Landmark 72 is the world’s 35th-highest building and the highest in Indochina Peninsula. Keangnam Enterprises indirectly owned a 70-percent stake in Landmark 72. The company invested over US$ 1 billion with US$ 510 million borrowed from banks.On 11 June 2008, an agreement was signed between the building owner and the InterContinental Hotels Group to operate the 359-room hotel under InterContinental Hanoi Landmark 72 with 9 Hotel Floors from 62nd Floor to 70th Floor (Hotel Club Lounge located on the 71st Floor).\nLandmark 72 is the site of Vietnam’s highest stair climbing race, the Vietnam Landmark 72 Hanoi Vertical Run. On 30 September 2012, runners competed for the first time to be the fastest to ascend the tower's 1,914 steps.\nIt was reported in early 2016 that a Vietnamese court valued the complex at US$ 770 million in May 2015 and AON Holdings from South Korea would take over the bank loan by paying US$ 373.4 million to become the majority owner.In early 2017, it emerged that a bribery scheme related to a proposed sale of Landmark 72 building complex in 2014 led to the arrest and charge of former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's nephew and charge of Ban's brother, Ban Ki-sang, an executive of South Korean firm Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd. In 2013, Keangnam was facing a liquidity crisis and intended to refinance or sale of the complex. When the 'deal' eventually fell through, Keangnam entered into court receivership in South Korea. A third element to the scheme was Malcolm Albert Harris, a self proclaimed New York City fashion designer who pled guilty to stealing five-hundred-thousand dollars as part of a phony negotiation to sell Landmark 72 to a Qatari royal.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Keangnam-Hanoi-Landmark-Tower.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Keangnam_Tower_01.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Keangnam_Tower_October_2010.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/LANDMARK72.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/LANDMARK72_night.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.017324,"longitude":105.784054,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower","type":"attraction"},{"content":"The Vietnam Museum of Ethnology (Vietnamese: Bảo tàng Dân tộc học Việt Nam) is a museum in Hanoi, Vietnam, which focuses on the 54 officially recognised ethnic groups in Vietnam.

It is regarded alongside the Perfume Temple, as one of Vietnam's two most iconic temples.The temple was built by Emperor Lý Thái Tông, who ruled from 1028 to 1054. According to the court records, Lý Thái Tông was childless and dreamt that he met the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, who handed him a baby son while seated on a lotus flower. Lý Thái Tông then married a peasant girl that he had met and she bore him a son. The emperor constructed the temple in gratitude for this in 1049, having been told by a monk named Thiền Tuệ to build the temple, by erecting a pillar in the middle of a lotus pond, similar to the one he saw in the dream.The temple was located in what was then the Tây Cấm Garden in Thạch Bảo, Vĩnh Thuận district in the capital Thăng Long (now known as Hanoi). Before the pagoda was opened, prayers were held for the longevity of the monarch. During the Lý Dynasty era, the temple was the site of an annual royal ceremony on the occasion of Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. A Buddha-bathing ceremony was held annually by the monarch, and it attracted monks and laymen alike to the ceremony. The monarch would then free a bird, which was followed by the people.The temple was renovated in 1105 by Emperor Lý Nhân Tông and a bell was cast and an installation was attempted in 1109. However, the bell, which was regarded as one of the four major capital works of Vietnam at the time, was much too large and heavy, and could not be installed. Since it could not be tolled while left on the ground, it was moved into the countryside and deposited in farmland adjacent to Nhất Trụ Temple. This land was widely inhabited by turtles, so the bell came to be known as Quy Điền chung, which means Bell of the Turtle Farmland. At the start of the 15th century, Vietnam was invaded and occupied by the Ming Dynasty. In 1426, the future Emperor Lê Lợi attacked and dispersed the Chinese forces, and while the Ming were in retreat and low on weapons, their commanding general ordered that the bell be smelted, so that the copper could be used for manufacturing weaponry.The temple is built of wood on a single stone pillar 1.25 m in diameter and 4 m in height, and it is designed to resemble a lotus blossom, which is a Buddhist symbol of purity, since a lotus blossoms in a muddy pond. In 1954, the French Union forces destroyed the pagoda before withdrawing from Vietnam after the First Indochina War. It was rebuilt afterwards.A replica was built in Thủ Đức in Saigon in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n","filters":{"historic":true,"indoors":true,"temples":true},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/ChuaMotCot1.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Chua_Mot_Cot.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/One_Pillar_Pagoda_0324.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_4.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.035863888889,"longitude":105.83331944444,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"One Pillar Pagoda","type":"attraction"},{"content":"Presidential Palace Historical Site (Vietnamese: Khu di tích Phủ Chủ tịch), which is located in Hanoi, Vietnam, is the place where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked in most of his revolutionary life (from December 19, 1954, to September 2, 1969).

Trúc Bạch Lake was separated from the West Lake by the construction of a narrow dike (Cổ Ngư, \"reinforcement\") in the 17th century to allow raising fish. The inhabitants of the Truc Yen Village, located on the south shore of the newly formed lake, were in the business of making bamboo blinds and hence cultivated a small variety of bamboo. In 1957 and 1958, major Thanh Niên Road was built between the lakes. In 1730s, the Trịnh Lord Trịnh Giang had Trúc Lâm Palace constructed on the lake shore. The building first served as a pleasure palace but was later converted into a prison for royal concubines found guilty of crime. The silk they produced, known as \"Bamboo Village Silk\" became famous for its beauty.\nThe lake front is open only along Thanh Niên Road, the other sides are occupied by houses and residential streets. The lake is among the most seriously polluted in Hanoi. Nearby historical sites include: Quán Thánh Temple to the southwest of the lake,  Châu Long Pagoda to the east, An Trì Temple (dedicated to the worship of a hero from the war against the Chinese Yuan Dynasty) on Phó Đức Chính Street, and Cẩu Nhi temple on a small hill near the northern corner of the lake.\n\n","filters":{"outdoors":true},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/John_McCain_monument_at_Tr%C3%BAc_B%E1%BA%A1ch_Lake%2C_Hanoi%2C_VN.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/John_McCain_monument_at_Tr%C3%BAc_B%E1%BA%A1ch_Lake%2C_Hanoi%2C_VN_%28angled%29.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/John_McCain_monument_at_Tr%C3%BAc_B%E1%BA%A1ch_Lake%2C_Hanoi%2C_VN_%28panoramic%29.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/John_McCain_monument_at_Tr%C3%BAc_B%E1%BA%A1ch_Lake%2C_Hanoi%2C_VN_%28text_detail%29.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_4.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Truc_Bach_Lake.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.045555555556,"longitude":105.83805555556,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Trúc Bạch Lake","type":"attraction"},{"content":"Trấn Quốc Pagoda (Vietnamese: Chùa Trấn Quốc, chữ Hán: 鎭國寺), the oldest Buddhist temple in Hanoi, is located on a small island near the southeastern shore of Hanoi's West Lake, Vietnam.\n\n","filters":{"historic":true,"indoors":true,"temples":true},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_4.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Tran_quoc_pagoda.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.047777777778,"longitude":105.83666666667,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Trấn Quốc Pagoda","type":"attraction"},{"content":"Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST; Vietnamese: Đại học Bách khoa Hà Nội, \"Hanoi University of Technology (HUT)(-2010); French: Institut polytechnique de Hanoï\"), founded 1956, is the first and largest technical university in Vietnam.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i_h%E1%BB%8Dc_B%C3%A1ch_khoa_H%C3%A0_N%E1%BB%99i_%28logo%29.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Bkks18Medium.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/HUT_students_in_ao_dai.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Hanoi_University_of_Technology_road.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Ta_Quang_Buu_library.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.006388888889,"longitude":105.84305555556,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Hanoi University of Science and Technology","type":"attraction"},{"content":"The Alcatraz Gang was a group of eleven American prisoners of war (POW) held separately in Hanoi, North Vietnam during the Vietnam War because of their particular resistance to their North-Vietnamese military captors. These eleven POWs were: George Thomas Coker, USN; Jeremiah Denton, USN; Harry Jenkins, USN; Sam Johnson, USAF; George McKnight, USAF; James Mulligan, USN; Howard Rutledge, USN; Robert Shumaker, USN; James Stockdale, USN; Ronald Storz, USAF; and Nels Tanner, USN.\n\nThese prisoners were held in solitary confinement from 25 October 1967 to 9 December 1969 at a special facility (dubbed \"Alcatraz\" by Commander Stockdale) in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, about a mile away from Hoa Lo prison (\"Hanoi Hilton\"-named by Lt. Commander Schumaker, the earliest captured prisoner among the eleven). The prisoners were shackled with legcuffs every night in 3-by-9-foot windowless concrete cells with the light on around the clock. The eleven Americans were separated because they were leaders of the prisoners' resistance\". Stockdale once tried to kill himself so that the North Vietnamese could not force him to make a propaganda film. The suicide attempt failed and the film was never made. Of Stockdale, Lt. Coker said \"He was probably the strongest, most exemplary leader of the whole North Vietnamese POW environment\". Coker and McKnight were the last POWs assigned to the Alcatraz Gang, being so assigned for previous fierce resistance to their treatment and an unsuccessful escape from the Power Plant or \"Dirty Bird\" prison camp.The group received special torture and were taken into torture sessions in order of rank, highest to lowest. Coker was the youngest and lowest ranking of the eleven POWs and was taken in last. He said he is still grateful for every minute the others held out. During the end of his session, something changed and the session stopped, which the POWs thought was because of a political decision from higher authorities to stop the sessions. All of the prisoners except Storz were moved to other prisons in December 1969. Storz, debilitated from sickness and untreated injuries, was left behind and died in captivity on 23 April 1970.When all the POWS were released from North Vietnam in February and March 1973 (Operation Homecoming), so much had changed back in the United States that Coker (and Commander Denton) said it was as if \"...we weren't here (in America) at all. We were strangers in our own country, and we didn't like a lot of what we saw\". Many still have throbbing in joints from the rope torture and Coker's wife says, \"In his sleep, he holds up 'the wall'\". Coker also said, \"If you're never tested, you don't know (what you can do)\".\nThree of the ten out of eleven surviving \"Alcatraz Gang\" POWs including Stockdale (he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1976), had died by November 2008. Denton died in 2014. The others keep in close touch.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/George_Coker_1973-crop.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Hanoi_Hilton_Map.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.025277777778,"longitude":105.84638888889,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Alcatraz Gang","type":"attraction"},{"content":"Hỏa Lò Prison (Vietnamese: [hwa᷉ː lɔ̂]) was a prison used by the French colonists in French Indochina for political prisoners, and later by North Vietnam for U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War.

Following the Geneva Accord of 1954, the French evacuated Vietnam and French Indochina came to an end.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/1er_CEPML.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Blank.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/B%C3%A2timents_172.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Colonies_of_the_second_French_colonial_empire.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/FrenchMarsouinsIndochina1888.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/French_Indochina_1937.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/French_Indochina_c._1930.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/French_Indochina_expansion.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/French_indochina_map.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Ho_Chi_Minh_1946.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Indochina_1954.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/La_Marseillaise_Rouget_de_Lisle_Musique_de_la_Garde_R%C3%A9publicaine.ogg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Long_bien_bridge.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/OccupationOfTrat1904.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Outre-mer_en.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Palais_du_Gouverneur_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral_%C3%A0_Sa%C3%AFgon_%281875%29.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/PhanBoiChau.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Presidential_Palace_of_Vietnam.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Siamese_Army_in_Laos_1893.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Th%E1%BB%91ng-Ch%E1%BA%BF_%C4%91%C3%A3_n%C3%B3i_-_%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i-Ph%C3%A1p_kh%E1%BA%AFng_kh%C3%ADt_v%E1%BB%9Bi_th%C3%A1i_b%C3%ACnh%2C_nh%C6%B0_d%C3%A2n_qu%C3%AA_v%E1%BB%9Bi_%C4%91%E1%BA%A5t_ru%E1%BB%99ng.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.0333,"longitude":105.85,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"French Indochina","type":"attraction"},{"content":"North Vietnam, officially the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) (Vietnamese: Việt Nam Dân Chủ Cộng Hòa), was a country in Southeast Asia from 1954 to 1975. \nVietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh declared independence from French Indochina on 2 September 1945 and announced the creation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh (\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists. In February 1951, the communists announced the creation of the Lao Động Party (Labor Party), gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Việt Minh.Between 1946 and 1954, the Việt Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam. In 1954, after the French were defeated, the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Việt Minh and granted Vietnam independence. The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones, and stipulated general elections in July 1956 to \"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\". The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam, and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam.\nSupervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland. The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, which stated that the United States \"shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly\". In July 1955, the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm, announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it.After the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War (1955–75). North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies, including the Soviet Union and China, fought against the military of South Vietnam, the United States and other anti-communist military forces, including South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and smaller players. North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments. The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated South Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-48550-0036%2C_Besuch_Ho_Chi_Minhs_bei_Pionieren%2C_bei_Berlin.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Chinh_phu_lam_thoi.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Map_of_Vietnam_-_B%E1%BA%A3n_%C4%91%E1%BB%93_Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam_-_Transparent_Background.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/United_States_Navy_Band_-_Ti%E1%BA%BFn_Qu%C3%A2n_Ca.ogg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.033333333333,"longitude":105.85,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"North Vietnam","type":"attraction"},{"content":"The Red River Delta (Vietnamese: Đồng Bằng Sông Hồng, or Châu Thổ Sông Hồng) is the flat low-lying plain formed by the Red River and its distributaries merging with the Thái Binh River in northern Vietnam.

The countries and regions funding the project are Wallonia, Belgium; Québec, Canada; France; French-speaking Switzerland; and Luxembourg.\nIFI recruits its students in Vietnam and other French-speaking countries. Professors at the member universities of the AUF (such as ENST Paris, Université catholique de Louvain, UQAM, etc.) come to IFI to give lectures. All courses are conducted in French.\nUsually, the final internship then takes place abroad (Europe or Canada) in industries, universities or research laboratories. Research internships are often used as a bridge toward a PhD. Industrial internships are taken by those who seek the profile of a project leader in software development.\nIFI is considered as one of the best graduate schools in computer science in Vietnam.

Hanoi is 1,720 km (1,070 mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City and 105 km (65 mi) west of Haiphong.\nFrom 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam. It was eclipsed by Huế, the imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguyễn Dynasty (1802–1945). In 1873 Hanoi was conquered by the French. From 1883 to 1945, the city was the administrative center of the colony of French Indochina. The French built a modern administrative city south of Old Hanoi, creating broad, perpendicular tree-lined avenues of opera, churches, public buildings, and luxury villas, but they also destroyed large parts of the city, shedding or reducing the size of lakes and canals, while also clearing out various imperial palaces and citadels.\nFrom 1940 to 1945 Hanoi, as well as most of French Indochina and Southeast Asia, was occupied by the Japanese empire. On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The Vietnamese National Assembly under Ho Chi Minh decided on January 6, 1946, to make Hanoi the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of North Vietnam, and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North's victory in the Vietnam War.\nOctober 2010 officially marked 1,000 years since the establishment of the city.

Low level street crimes like bag snatching regularly occur in major cities like Hanoi and Saigon. Few instances of knife attacks during robberies have been reported.\nAvoid fights and arguments with locals (especially groups). Keep in mind that yelling is highly insulting to Vietnamese, so the reaction of a Vietnamese in such a situation may be unexpected.\nAs a foreigner, Vietnamese expect you to act a certain way in their country. You should respect the general law of the land. Most of these arguments can be avoided easily by showing general courtesy, and tolerating cultural differences that may seem rude to you.\nStreet robbery\nTouristy areas and high population cities in Vietnam are areas to watch for thieves, pickpockets, and scammers. They especially target foreigners. Pickpockets and motorbike snatching have found their home especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Nha Trang. Thieves on motorbikes will snatch bags, mobile phones, cameras, and jewelery off pedestrians and other motorbike drivers, and it is a crime committed so regularly that even local Vietnamese are common victims. Avoid dangling your bags along traffic roads. Talking on your mobile phone next to cars on the road and putting your bag on the front basket of a motorbike will tempt a robber. It could happen day or night, in a crowded road with hundreds of drivers. Pickpockets are well organized and operate in groups.\nIf you travel by motorbike, be aware that crooks can cause serious security issues. Reports of people claiming that \"your motorcycle is on fire\" and offering to repair it or passers-by that throw nails at foreigners on motorcycles are frequent.\nTheft\nAlso infamously common are thefts on popular beaches. Never leave your bag unattended on beaches. In hotel rooms, including five star ones, reports that belongings are stolen have been heard regularly by hotel staff, especially when it comes to small personal items of high value (cash, digital cameras, etc), so take your cash or put it in a security deposit box, and the same with small digital equipment. There are many places where leaving larger electronics like laptops in the room is perfectly fine. The most effective preventative step is to only book hotel rooms at places that have a good reputation and reviews.\nCon men\nOne of the tricks employed by con men is targeting tourists traveling on bikes by deliberately crashing into tourists bikes to blame them to extort money.\nShow special caution when drinking with Vietnamese men.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"country","name":"wikitravel country","page":"Vietnam","section":70,"sectionName":"Stay safe","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Crime"},{"content":"Vietnam probably has the most scams per square foot, and significantly more than in surrounding countries. One certain trait of Vietnamese scams is that there seems to be no limit to what people would try to overcharge you. It is pretty common for the scammers to attempt to overcharge you by ten or fifty times and sometimes even more.\nA very common one is when the organizers claim that the bus broke down and the tour operators force people to pay huge amounts for crummy hotels \"while the bus is repaired\".\nBe careful when going to a shop or restaurant that doesn't have prices written down. Before eating a meal, ask for the price or you may be in for a surprising bill. When you embark on a tourist tour, be independent: know where you are at all times and be aware of alternatives; the tour might suddenly fall apart. \nThe police are probably the worst crooks of them all. They are known to steal items from people (both locals and tourists) and ask for a steep bribe to get the item in return. Also, don't count on them for any help if you are victim of crime.\nMost scams in Vietnam are in transport, hotel prices and the two-menus system practiced by some restaurants. \nHotel owners may tell you that the room price is 200,000 dong. However, when checking out, they may insist that the price is USD20, charging you almost a double. Another trick is to tell customers that a \"room\" is a few dollars, but following day they'll say that price was for a fan room only and it's another price for an air-con room. These days, legitimate hotel owners seem to be aware of these scams and are usually willing to help by writing down how much the room is per person per day (in US dollars or dong), if it has air con or not. Staff of legitimate hotels also never ask for payment from a guest when they check in. Watch out if they insist that you should pay when you check out but refuse to write down the price on paper.\nSome restaurants are known to have two menus, one for local people and another one for foreigners. The only way to deal with it is to learn a few Vietnamese phrases and insist that you should be shown only the Vietnamese menu. If they hesitate to show you the local menu, you better walk away.\nOn rare occasions restaurants have two (English) menus with different prices. Taking pictures of all menus might be excessive, but if you suspect that the food had a different price when ordered, stand your ground. We usually memorize the prices of what we order and pay exactly that. The owners rarely make a big deal out of it because they know they cheated. Otherwise ask for the police.\nMany taxi drivers in Saigon and Hanoi install rigged meters, charging up to 2 to 8 times more. The best way to reduce your chances is by taking a taxi from reputable companies such as Mai Linh (+84 38 38 38 38) and Vinasun in Saigon and Mai Linh and Hanoi Tourist for Hanoi (but note that taking these companies is not a guarantee, and travelers have had problems even with reputable companies). If you don't know what a reasonable fare is, it is generally a bad idea to agree on a price in advance. Spoken for Saigon, the two recommended companies have quite reliable meters. Vinasun taxis usually have notices explaining that the meter value should be multiplied by 1000 to obtain the fare. Some drivers will take advantage of the ambiguity, and tourists' lack of knowledge about what the fare should be, so it is best to have things clearly written out.\nTaxis are abundant in Saigon - and you can get a taxi at any time of the day or (night). You can also call a Taxi, and usually people at call centers will be able to either converse in English, or will pass on the phone to someone who can. Rule of thumb to detect scammers: if the taxi doesn't have the fare charges written, or drivers name and photo on the dashboard, immediately ask the taxi to stop and get out. It's a definite scam.\nWhen leaving the airport, the taxi driver may insist that you pay the airport toll. He might not be very forthcoming about the price and, if you give him cash, he will pay the toll and pocket the rest.\nMany taxi drivers in Sai Gon and Ha Noi try to overcharge thin faced, just arrived, and gullible travelers. You should consult some guidebooks and travel forums to prepare yourself for those petty scams and to learn more about how to avoid them. The airport toll fee in Saigon is 10,000 dong (as of July 2012) - this is  also written, along with the fare, on the dashboard of the taxi. You can confidently say \"airport toll only 10,000\" and refuse to pay anything else such as parking etc. (unless there were more toll roads in between). Usually, the driver will not argue it out. In Saigon, a trip to Backpackers Street should not cost more than 250,000 dong from the airport in any case.\nIn several other cities of Vietnam, such as Dalat, Hoi An, Nha Trang etc. - DO NOT travel by meter. The airports are as far as 30-40km from these places and meter will cost you from 500,000 to 650,000 dong. However, you can either take a bus from the Airport to  the city center, or pre-negotiate rates with taxis from 200,000-300,000 dong. Refer to individual sections for details. Pay attention to sides of taxi - usually a rate for Airport drop is written on the door itself. \nTaxi and cyclo drivers may claim that they don't have change when accepting payment for an agreed-upon fare.  The best way to handle this is to either carry smaller bills or be ready to stand your ground.  Generally the driver is only trying to get an extra dollar or so by rounding the fare up, but to prevent this scam from becoming more popular it is advised to stay calm and firm about the price.  \nWhen you meet an over friendly cyclo driver who says, \"never mind how much you would pay\" or \"you can pay whatever you like at the end of the trip\". He even tries to show you his book of comments from international tourists. This kind of driver has to be a scammer. If you still want to use his service you should make it clear about the agreed price and don't pay more than that. Just be clear what you are willing to pay; the cyclo drivers are just trying to make a living.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"country","name":"wikitravel country","page":"Vietnam","section":71,"sectionName":"Stay safe","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Scams"},{"content":"Corruption is a big problem in Vietnam and locals are convinced that the police are not to be trusted. Police officers may stop motorcycle riders for any reason including missing insurance papers or a missing driving license, and fine you around USD$20 for each offense (the average traffic fine should only be about USD$5-$10). Remember to stand your ground and all officers are required to write all traffic violations in their notebook and give you a receipt with directions to pay to the station (not the officer). If you have a cell phone, threaten to call your embassy and he may back down. However, you might just find it easier to pay the fine and get on your way. \nImmigration officers are known to take bribes.

Some intersections in main cities (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City) have traffic lights patrolled by police.\nTo cross the road, don't try to avoid the cars, let them avoid you. Step confidently forward, a little more, and you will see motorcycle drivers to slow down a bit, or go to another way. Make your pace and path predictable and obvious to other drivers. Don't change your speed or direction suddenly. Then move forward until you hit your destination. The best strategy is just to keep walking forward at a comfortable pace.\nThe simplest way, if available, is to follow a local, stand next to them in the opposite side of the traffic (if you get hit, he will get it first) and he will give you the best chance of crossing a road. \nIf you are injured, don't expect that local people are willing to help for even calling an ambulance because it is not free. Make sure you tell local clearly that you will pay the ambulance fee. Hospitals will also not accept your admission unless you prove that you can pay the bill.\nHighways are also risky with an average of 30 deaths a day and some locals will not even venture on them if not in a big vehicle (car or bus). Taking a bicycle or motorcycle on highways is an adventure for risk takers, definitely not for a family with children.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"country","name":"wikitravel country","page":"Vietnam","section":74,"sectionName":"Stay safe","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"Traffic"},{"content":"Petty crime in night clubs can happen.

Most cab drivers are paid by KTVs and lounges to bring in foreign tourists. Usually when you walk in they will tell you a set of pricing which seems reasonable; but when you check out the bill will include a number of extravagant charges.

Men on motorbikes rush around delivering potted tangerine trees and flowering bushes, the traditional household decorations. People get a little bit stressed out and the elbows get sharper, especially in big cities, where the usual hectic level of traffic becomes almost homicidal. Then a few days before Tết the pace begins to slow down, as thousands of city residents depart for their ancestral home towns in the provinces. Finally on the first day of the new year an abrupt transformation occurs: the streets become quiet, almost deserted. Nearly all shops and restaurants close for three days, (the exception being a few that cater especially to foreign visitors; and hotels operate as usual.)\nIn the major cities, streets are decorated with lights and public festivities are organized which attract many thousands of residents. But for Vietnamese, Tết is mostly a private, family celebration. On the eve of the new year, families gather together and exchange good wishes (from more junior to more senior) and gifts of \"lucky money\" (from more senior to more junior). In the first three days of the year, the daytime hours are devoted to visiting -- houses of relatives on the first day, closest friends and important colleagues on the second day, and everyone else on the third day. Many people also visit pagodas. The evening hours are spent drinking and gambling (men) or chatting, playing, singing karaoke, and enjoying traditional snacks and candy (women and children.)\nVisiting Vietnam during Tết has good points and bad points. On the minus side: modes of transport are jammed just before the holiday as many Vietnamese travel to their home towns; hotels fill up, especially in smaller towns; and your choice of shopping and dining is severely limited in the first days of the new year (with a few places closed up to two weeks). In Saigon, most shops are closed for a whole week after new years day. Restaurants may charge a higher than normal price, e.g. adding a 20% \"Happy New Year\" fee. Beware that crowded places are ideal for pickpockets. On the plus side, you can observe the preparations and enjoy the public festivities; pagodas are especially active; no admission is charged to those museums and historical sites that stay open; and the foreigner-oriented travel industry of backpacker buses and resort hotels chugs along as usual. Visitors also stand a chance of being invited to join the festivities, especially if you have some local connections or manage to make some Vietnamese friends during your stay. When visiting during Tết, it's wise to get settled somewhere at least two days before the new year, and don't try to move again until a couple of days after.\nLesser holidays include:\n\nNew Year 1 January.\nHùng Kings' Festival (Giỗ tổ Hùng Vương) on the 10th day of the 3rd lunar month commemorating the first kings of Vietnam.\nLiberation Day (Ngày giải phóng miền Nam) on 30 April, marking the fall of Saigon in 1975. \nInternational Workers' Day (Ngày Quốc tế Lao động) 1 May, the traditional socialist labour day. Around those times (Vietnamese often call 30 Apr-1 May holiday - the second longest holiday after Tết), trains and planes tend to be sold out, and accommodations at holiday destionations are hard to find. Best to book far in advance.\nNational Day (Quốc khánh) 2 September.\n\n\n\n"}}}},"region":[{"automated":{"content":"Traffic in Hanoi \nTaxis are the best way to travel long distances, but the cyclos, or pedicabs, are a cheap way to make shorter trips. Taxi fares are not always consistent, and the rates for each taxi company have not been standardized. For lone travellers, rides on the back of motorbikes (actually low-powered scooters) are popular too (known as xe om, literally meaning motorbike-hug).  Uber no longer operates in Hanoi (July 2018) but Grab taxis or motorbikes are freely available via the app.\n\nBy taxi","getting around":{"items":[{"content":"Some meter taxi owners in Hanoi will attempt to negotiate a flat fee in advance rather than use the meter. If you have a fair idea of how far you're going or how much you're willing to pay, this is probably a good idea. If the driver refuses, turning around and walking away will almost certainly change his mind. Don't sweat it, it's all part of the expected negotiation protocol. It has also become common for the drivers of some of the less reputable taxi companies to \"fix\" their meters to run faster hence running up a high bill very fast! The recommendation is to only use the reputable and reliable taxi companies. These are Hanoi Group Taxi, ☎ +84 4 3856 5656), Mai Linh Taxi , ☎ +84 4 3861 6161). As a reference point, Hanoi Group Taxi charges an initial fee of 14,000 dong as a starting price that covers the first few kilometres, then 16,300 dong for every additional kilometre of travel, with 6,000 dong for every 5 minutes of travel. Given this, you should be able to get a general sense of what a reasonable price is in getting around town. Thanh Nga taxis (+84 4 4 3821 5215) are cheaper with smaller, hatchback cars, starting at 9,000 dong + 12,000 dong/km.\nAnother common scam by taxis is that the driver takes you for a \"sightseeing\" - and extends the tour to make more money. This is very hard to discover unless you know the city well, but if you catch your driver doing this (e.g. going around Hoan Kiem Lake twice), demand that he stop the taxi and leave the taxi without paying. \nBe very careful with meter taxis in Hanoi. Meters have been known to operate \"normally\" initially, but after you've let your guard down, it jumps to astronomical amounts just before the destination. Some have central locking, and are known to lock passengers in, and demand large amounts of US dollars before letting them go. The driver may threaten to have you beaten up or arrested should you not give in to his demands, but if you kick up enough of a fuss, they will let you go.\nMost taxi drivers speak limited English, so it's a good practice to get your hotel to write the name and address of you destination in Vietnamese to show the taxi driver, and get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.\nBe vigilant when taking a taxi - driver jumps out at destination and dumps most of your bags out of the trunk. While you're busy putting rucksack on he has taken off with your other bags.\nBe vigilant also  the  meter which  can  run as far or  even faster than a  digital clock. A 10min drive can rack up almost USD30 in downtown Hanoi alone! Do  keep an  eye on the meter during  the  journey. Fare flag drops starting at 15,000 dong. Bottom line: Stick to the reliable taxi companies listed above to avoid scams. You should take photo or remember taxi number in case you are in bad situation, you can solve it.\nWhen getting off your taxi wait for the driver to open your door, or check both front and back to see if there are any motorcycles whizzing past before opening your door. Although Vietnam is right-hand traffic, ghost motorbike riders could be approaching your taxi on the wrong side.\n\n\n\n","source":{"area":"region","name":"wikitravel region","page":"Hanoi","section":10,"sectionName":"Get around","source":"wikitravel page"},"title":"By taxi"},{"content":"As of December 2018, Uber is no longer available in South East Asia, including Vietnam. \nGrab offers an Uber-like service, along with several options: GrabCar (private car), GrabTaxi (metered taxis using the Grab app) and GrabBike (hop on the back of a GrabBike tagged motorbike, helmet provided).

The ticket will either have your license plate number written on it, or the ticket itself will be numbered, with that number subsequently chalked somewhere on your bike.  In such cases (where you've been given a ticket), the attendants may ask that you NOT lock the steering column or front wheel of your bike so that they can rearrange the bikes as customers come and go.\nRiding outside the city is a refreshing change. Winding through the alleys and through the local markets inaccessible by cars allows you to see Hanoi from a different perspective. Google maps are rather useless once you leave the city due to the number of small lanes, forked roads and roundabouts that do not show up on the map.

The Chinese conquered the imperial city of Thang-Long in 1408 and renamed it Tống Bình. Le Loi repelled the invaders in 1428 and ascended the throne, becoming known as Lê Thái Tổ (黎太祖); for his efforts, a slew of legends about his heroic exploits, many centred around the Hoan Kiem Lake in the Old Quarter. \nThe Nguyen Dynasty gave the city its modern name of Ha Noi in 1831, but they had transferred power to Hue by then; it remained there until 1887, when the French made Saigon and then Hanoi the capital of all French Indochina. It changed hands again in 1954, when it was ceded to Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh after almost a decade of fighting, and it became the capital of North Vietnam; Saigon was the rival in South Vietnam.

Nine hundred years later, the first western-style universities in Vietnam were also founded in Hanoi. The city is one of the leading centres of scientific study and research in the country. Hanoi retains much of its older charm of bygone eras, despite the battles that have raged over it; conflict had the side effect of making it largely oblivious to modern architecture, and as a result, few buildings in the city centre area are higher than five stories.

It trades the commercial boom and sprawl of Ho Chi Minh City in the South for a more understated charm, worth enjoying for an extra day or two, and with countless transport options and travel agents, it makes a perfect base for exploration of the North.\nAs you walk along the street, you may find that people start talking to you. It is a cultural norm there to make conversation with strangers. They might ask you where you are from and other general questions. It takes a while to get used to that.

The complex consists of one 72-story Mixed-use tower with the height of 350 m and two 48-storey hotel twin towers. Landmark 72 is located on an area of 46,054 m2 and the total floor area is 609,673 m2, ranked 5th as the largest floor area of a single building in the world. The investor as well as the executor and operator of this complex is the South Korea-based company named Keangnam Enterprises, Ltd. The investment capital for this complex is estimated $1.05 billion USD.On November 2010, the main tower reached approximately 300 metres, making it the tallest building and structure in Vietnam. On 24 January 2011, the main tower topped out at 350 metres; it became the tallest building in Vietnam while the other two towers had topped out months before with the height of 212 metres.\nThe complex features a 5-star InterContinental hotel, offices, entertainment areas, retail spaces, clinics and convention centres. The complex opened for business on 18 May 2012. Landmark 72 is the world’s 35th-highest building and the highest in Indochina Peninsula. Keangnam Enterprises indirectly owned a 70-percent stake in Landmark 72. The company invested over US$ 1 billion with US$ 510 million borrowed from banks.On 11 June 2008, an agreement was signed between the building owner and the InterContinental Hotels Group to operate the 359-room hotel under InterContinental Hanoi Landmark 72 with 9 Hotel Floors from 62nd Floor to 70th Floor (Hotel Club Lounge located on the 71st Floor).\nLandmark 72 is the site of Vietnam’s highest stair climbing race, the Vietnam Landmark 72 Hanoi Vertical Run. On 30 September 2012, runners competed for the first time to be the fastest to ascend the tower's 1,914 steps.\nIt was reported in early 2016 that a Vietnamese court valued the complex at US$ 770 million in May 2015 and AON Holdings from South Korea would take over the bank loan by paying US$ 373.4 million to become the majority owner.In early 2017, it emerged that a bribery scheme related to a proposed sale of Landmark 72 building complex in 2014 led to the arrest and charge of former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's nephew and charge of Ban's brother, Ban Ki-sang, an executive of South Korean firm Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd. In 2013, Keangnam was facing a liquidity crisis and intended to refinance or sale of the complex. When the 'deal' eventually fell through, Keangnam entered into court receivership in South Korea. A third element to the scheme was Malcolm Albert Harris, a self proclaimed New York City fashion designer who pled guilty to stealing five-hundred-thousand dollars as part of a phony negotiation to sell Landmark 72 to a Qatari royal.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Keangnam-Hanoi-Landmark-Tower.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Keangnam_Tower_01.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Keangnam_Tower_October_2010.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/LANDMARK72.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/LANDMARK72_night.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.017324,"longitude":105.784054,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower","type":"attraction"},{},{"content":"The Vietnam Museum of Ethnology (Vietnamese: Bảo tàng Dân tộc học Việt Nam) is a museum in Hanoi, Vietnam, which focuses on the 54 officially recognised ethnic groups in Vietnam.

It is regarded alongside the Perfume Temple, as one of Vietnam's two most iconic temples.The temple was built by Emperor Lý Thái Tông, who ruled from 1028 to 1054. According to the court records, Lý Thái Tông was childless and dreamt that he met the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, who handed him a baby son while seated on a lotus flower. Lý Thái Tông then married a peasant girl that he had met and she bore him a son. The emperor constructed the temple in gratitude for this in 1049, having been told by a monk named Thiền Tuệ to build the temple, by erecting a pillar in the middle of a lotus pond, similar to the one he saw in the dream.The temple was located in what was then the Tây Cấm Garden in Thạch Bảo, Vĩnh Thuận district in the capital Thăng Long (now known as Hanoi). Before the pagoda was opened, prayers were held for the longevity of the monarch. During the Lý Dynasty era, the temple was the site of an annual royal ceremony on the occasion of Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. A Buddha-bathing ceremony was held annually by the monarch, and it attracted monks and laymen alike to the ceremony. The monarch would then free a bird, which was followed by the people.The temple was renovated in 1105 by Emperor Lý Nhân Tông and a bell was cast and an installation was attempted in 1109. However, the bell, which was regarded as one of the four major capital works of Vietnam at the time, was much too large and heavy, and could not be installed. Since it could not be tolled while left on the ground, it was moved into the countryside and deposited in farmland adjacent to Nhất Trụ Temple. This land was widely inhabited by turtles, so the bell came to be known as Quy Điền chung, which means Bell of the Turtle Farmland. At the start of the 15th century, Vietnam was invaded and occupied by the Ming Dynasty. In 1426, the future Emperor Lê Lợi attacked and dispersed the Chinese forces, and while the Ming were in retreat and low on weapons, their commanding general ordered that the bell be smelted, so that the copper could be used for manufacturing weaponry.The temple is built of wood on a single stone pillar 1.25 m in diameter and 4 m in height, and it is designed to resemble a lotus blossom, which is a Buddhist symbol of purity, since a lotus blossoms in a muddy pond. In 1954, the French Union forces destroyed the pagoda before withdrawing from Vietnam after the First Indochina War. It was rebuilt afterwards.A replica was built in Thủ Đức in Saigon in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\n","filters":{"historic":true,"indoors":true,"temples":true},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/ChuaMotCot1.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Chua_Mot_Cot.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/One_Pillar_Pagoda_0324.JPG"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Th%C3%A1p_R%C3%B9a_4.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.035863888889,"longitude":105.83331944444,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"One Pillar Pagoda","type":"attraction"},{},{"content":"Presidential Palace Historical Site (Vietnamese: Khu di tích Phủ Chủ tịch), which is located in Hanoi, Vietnam, is the place where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked in most of his revolutionary life (from December 19, 1954, to September 2, 1969).

Trúc Bạch Lake was separated from the West Lake by the construction of a narrow dike (Cổ Ngư, \"reinforcement\") in the 17th century to allow raising fish. The inhabitants of the Truc Yen Village, located on the south shore of the newly formed lake, were in the business of making bamboo blinds and hence cultivated a small variety of bamboo. In 1957 and 1958, major Thanh Niên Road was built between the lakes. In 1730s, the Trịnh Lord Trịnh Giang had Trúc Lâm Palace constructed on the lake shore. The building first served as a pleasure palace but was later converted into a prison for royal concubines found guilty of crime.

These eleven POWs were: George Thomas Coker, USN; Jeremiah Denton, USN; Harry Jenkins, USN; Sam Johnson, USAF; George McKnight, USAF; James Mulligan, USN; Howard Rutledge, USN; Robert Shumaker, USN; James Stockdale, USN; Ronald Storz, USAF; and Nels Tanner, USN.\n\nThese prisoners were held in solitary confinement from 25 October 1967 to 9 December 1969 at a special facility (dubbed \"Alcatraz\" by Commander Stockdale) in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, about a mile away from Hoa Lo prison (\"Hanoi Hilton\"-named by Lt. Commander Schumaker, the earliest captured prisoner among the eleven). The prisoners were shackled with legcuffs every night in 3-by-9-foot windowless concrete cells with the light on around the clock. The eleven Americans were separated because they were leaders of the prisoners' resistance\". Stockdale once tried to kill himself so that the North Vietnamese could not force him to make a propaganda film. The suicide attempt failed and the film was never made. Of Stockdale, Lt. Coker said \"He was probably the strongest, most exemplary leader of the whole North Vietnamese POW environment\". Coker and McKnight were the last POWs assigned to the Alcatraz Gang, being so assigned for previous fierce resistance to their treatment and an unsuccessful escape from the Power Plant or \"Dirty Bird\" prison camp.The group received special torture and were taken into torture sessions in order of rank, highest to lowest. Coker was the youngest and lowest ranking of the eleven POWs and was taken in last. He said he is still grateful for every minute the others held out. During the end of his session, something changed and the session stopped, which the POWs thought was because of a political decision from higher authorities to stop the sessions. All of the prisoners except Storz were moved to other prisons in December 1969. Storz, debilitated from sickness and untreated injuries, was left behind and died in captivity on 23 April 1970.When all the POWS were released from North Vietnam in February and March 1973 (Operation Homecoming), so much had changed back in the United States that Coker (and Commander Denton) said it was as if \"...we weren't here (in America) at all. We were strangers in our own country, and we didn't like a lot of what we saw\". Many still have throbbing in joints from the rope torture and Coker's wife says, \"In his sleep, he holds up 'the wall'\". Coker also said, \"If you're never tested, you don't know (what you can do)\".\nThree of the ten out of eleven surviving \"Alcatraz Gang\" POWs including Stockdale (he was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1976), had died by November 2008. Denton died in 2014. The others keep in close touch.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/George_Coker_1973-crop.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Hanoi_Hilton_Map.jpg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.025277777778,"longitude":105.84638888889,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"Alcatraz Gang","type":"attraction"},{"content":"Hỏa Lò Prison (Vietnamese: [hwa᷉ː lɔ̂]) was a prison used by the French colonists in French Indochina for political prisoners, and later by North Vietnam for U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War.

France reasserted its colonial dominance and a war ensued between France and the Viet Minh, led by President Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh (\"League for the Independence of Vietnam\") was a coalition of nationalist groups, mostly led by communists. In February 1951, the communists announced the creation of the Lao Động Party (Labor Party), gradually marginalizing non-communists in the Việt Minh.Between 1946 and 1954, the Việt Minh captured and controlled most of the rural areas of Vietnam. In 1954, after the French were defeated, the negotiation of the Geneva Accords ended the war between France and the Việt Minh and granted Vietnam independence. The Geneva Accords divided the country provisionally into northern and southern zones, and stipulated general elections in July 1956 to \"bring about the unification of Viet-Nam\". The northern zone was commonly called North Vietnam, and the southern zone was commonly called South Vietnam.\nSupervision of the implementation of the Geneva Accords was the responsibility of an international commission consisting of India, Canada, and Poland. The United States did not sign the Geneva Accords, which stated that the United States \"shall continue to seek to achieve unity through free elections supervised by the United Nations to insure that they are conducted fairly\". In July 1955, the prime minister of the Republic of Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm, announced that South Vietnam would not participate in elections to unify the country. He said that South Vietnam had not signed the Geneva Accords and was not bound by it.After the failure to reunify Vietnam by elections, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attempted to unify the country by force in the Vietnam War (1955–75). North Vietnam and the Việt Cộng insurgents supported by their communist allies, including the Soviet Union and China, fought against the military of South Vietnam, the United States and other anti-communist military forces, including South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and smaller players. North Vietnam also supported indigenous communist rebels in Cambodia and Laos against their respective U.S.-backed governments. The war ended when North Vietnamese forces and the Việt Cộng defeated South Vietnam and in 1976 united the two parts of the country into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The expanded Democratic Republic retained North Vietnam's political culture under Soviet influence and continued its existing memberships in international organisations such as Comecon.\n\n","filters":{},"images":[{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-48550-0036%2C_Besuch_Ho_Chi_Minhs_bei_Pionieren%2C_bei_Berlin.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Chinh_phu_lam_thoi.jpg"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Map_of_Vietnam_-_B%E1%BA%A3n_%C4%91%E1%BB%93_Vi%E1%BB%87t_Nam_-_Transparent_Background.png"},{"type":"url","url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/United_States_Navy_Band_-_Ti%E1%BA%BFn_Qu%C3%A2n_Ca.ogg"}],"location":{"country":"vi","latitude":21.033333333333,"longitude":105.85,"region":"hanoi"},"source":"wikipedia","title":"North Vietnam","type":"attraction"},{"content":"The Red River Delta (Vietnamese: Đồng Bằng Sông Hồng, or Châu Thổ Sông Hồng) is the flat low-lying plain formed by the Red River and its distributaries merging with the Thái Binh River in northern Vietnam.

The city mostly lies on the right bank of the Red River. Hanoi is 1,720 km (1,070 mi) north of Ho Chi Minh City and 105 km (65 mi) west of Haiphong.\nFrom 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam. It was eclipsed by Huế, the imperial capital of Vietnam during the Nguyễn Dynasty (1802–1945). In 1873 Hanoi was conquered by the French. From 1883 to 1945, the city was the administrative center of the colony of French Indochina. The French built a modern administrative city south of Old Hanoi, creating broad, perpendicular tree-lined avenues of opera, churches, public buildings, and luxury villas, but they also destroyed large parts of the city, shedding or reducing the size of lakes and canals, while also clearing out various imperial palaces and citadels.\nFrom 1940 to 1945 Hanoi, as well as most of French Indochina and Southeast Asia, was occupied by the Japanese empire. On September 2, 1945, Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). The Vietnamese National Assembly under Ho Chi Minh decided on January 6, 1946, to make Hanoi the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of North Vietnam, and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North's victory in the Vietnam War.\nOctober 2010 officially marked 1,000 years since the establishment of the city.
